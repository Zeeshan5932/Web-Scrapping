NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING




NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that on Monday, March 10, 2025, at 7:00 p.m. in the City
Council Chambers of City Hall, 5111 Benito Street, Montclair, CA 91763, the 
Planning Commission of the City of Montclair will conduct a public hearing
concerning Case No. 2024-59 pertaining to the following:




PROJECT LOCATION: 4.4-acre portion of the Costco Wholesale development at 9404
Central Avenue (a portion of Assessor Parcel Numbers:1008-361-16-0000)




APPLICANT: Costco Wholesale Corporation, c/o Alberto Esquivel, Senior Planner
Barghausen




PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Costco Wholesale is seeking to relocate on-site and expand
its existing fuel facility on a 4.4-acre portion of the Costco Wholesale
development at 9404 Central Avenue. The Project Site includes the existing fuel
facility, the northernmost parking areas along the west and east property
boundary, and two direct driveway access points. The Costco warehouse building
and the existing fuel facility combined encompass 14 acres and were approved
under Conditional Use Permit and Precise Plan of Design No. 2000-14 and
Environmental Impact Report No. 2000031036. The originally approved fuel
facility was expanded under Conditional Use Permit No. 2004-37.




The Applicant is requesting a Conditional Use Permit Amendment and a Precise
Plan of Design to allow the construction and operation of sixteen multi-product
dispensers (MPDs) (32 fueling positions) with a 12,684 square-foot canopy, three
(3) 40,000-gallon gasoline underground storage tanks, (USTs) one (1)
1,500-gallon additive UST and associated site improvements such as landscaping
and parking lot striping. Once the new facility is operational, the existing
fuel facility would be decommissioned and demolished, and the remaining site
improvements, including landscape, site lighting, parking, and directional
striping, would be completed.









The project primarily aims to improve fueling operations and reduce vehicle
queueing at the existing facility.




ZONING: Commerce - Mixed Use per the Montclair Corridors Code

facility was expanded under Conditional Use Permit No. 2004-37.




The Applicant is requesting a Conditional Use Permit Amendment and a Precise
Plan of Design to allow the construction and operation of sixteen multi-product
dispensers (MPDs) (32 fueling positions) with a 12,684 square-foot canopy, three
(3) 40,000-gallon gasoline underground storage tanks, (USTs) one (1)

NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING




NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that on Monday, March 10, 2025, at 7:00 p.m. in the City
Council Chambers of City Hall, 5111 Benito Street, Montclair, CA 91763, the 
Planning Commission of the City of Montclair will conduct a public hearing
concerning Case No. 2024-59 pertaining to the following:




PROJECT LOCATION: 4.4-acre portion of the Costco Wholesale development at 9404
Central Avenue (a portion of Assessor Parcel Numbers:1008-361-16-0000)




APPLICANT: Costco Wholesale Corporation, c/o Alberto Esquivel, Senior Planner
Barghausen




PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Costco Wholesale is seeking to relocate on-site and expand
its existing fuel facility on a 4.4-acre portion of the Costco Wholesale
development at 9404 Central Avenue. The Project Site includes the existing fuel
facility, the northernmost parking areas along the west and east property
boundary, and two direct driveway access points. The Costco warehouse building
and the existing fuel facility combined encompass 14 acres and were approved
under Conditional Use Permit and Precise Plan of Design No. 2000-14 and
Environmental Impact Report No. 2000031036. The originally approved fuel
facility was expanded under Conditional Use Permit No. 2004-37.




The Applicant is requesting a Conditional Use Permit Amendment and a Precise
Plan of Design to allow the construction and operation of sixteen multi-product
dispensers (MPDs) (32 fueling positions) with a 12,684 square-foot canopy, three
(3) 40,000-gallon gasoline underground storage tanks, (USTs) one (1)
1,500-gallon additive UST and associated site improvements such as landscaping
and parking lot striping. Once the new facility is operational, the existing
fuel facility would be decommissioned and demolished, and the remaining site
improvements, including landscape, site lighting, parking, and directional
striping, would be completed.









The project primarily aims to improve fueling operations and reduce vehicle
queueing at the existing facility.




ZONING: Commerce - Mixed Use per the Montclair Corridors Code

Categorically Exempt pursuant to Class 32. The Class 32 " Infill' Categorical
