    "**Explanation of the code:**\n",
    "- `import requests` and `from bs4 import BeautifulSoup`: Import libraries for HTTP requests and HTML parsing.\n",
    "- `news_url = \"https://www.bbc.com/news\"`: Set the URL for the BBC News homepage.\n",
    "- `requests.get(news_url).content`: Fetch the HTML content of the page.\n",
    "- `BeautifulSoup(..., \"html.parser\")`: Parse the HTML content.\n",
    "- Try to find all `<h3>` tags with the class `gs-c-promo-heading__title` (common for headlines).\n",
    "- If not found, try anchor tags with class `gs-c-promo-heading`.\n",
    "- If still not found, fallback to all anchor tags with `/news/` in their `href` and non-empty text.\n",
